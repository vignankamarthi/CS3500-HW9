/**
 * This interface represents the behaviors for the Pawns Board game.
 * It provides the functionality needed to play the game including initializing the game,
 * making player moves, retrieving game state, and determining the winner.
 *
 * <p>The Pawns Board game is a two-player card game played on a board
 * where players place {@link Card}s from their hand onto cells with their pawns.
 * Cards influence cells based on their influence pattern.</p>
 *
 *
 * <p>Different implementations of this interface may (just examples, list could go on):</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Support different board configurations beyond rectangular</li>
 *   <li>Implement alternative influence mechanics beyond the standard add/convert pawns</li>
 *   <li>Provide different starting configurations for the board</li>
 *   <li>Support various scoring strategies</li>
 *   <li>Provide any sort of deck and hand sizes</li>
 *   <li>...</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementations must preserve these core INVARIANTS:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Every board implementation must use a grid representation with rows and columns,
 *       regardless of the board's shape</li>
 *   <li>A cell can only contain one type of content (empty, pawns, or a card)</li>
 *   <li>Cards are only placed in cells with enough pawns to cover their cost</li>
 *   <li>Cards cannot be placed on cells with pawns owned by another player</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <C> the type of Card used in this game
 * @param <E> the type of Cell used in this game's board
